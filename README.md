# To-Do List Application

A simple and intuitive To-Do List application built with React. This app allows users to:

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a description.
- **Mark as Completed**: Toggle tasks between completed and pending status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Task Management**: Add, update, and delete tasks with ease.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling.
- **Local Storage**: For saving tasks data.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/francescasinlah/final-project.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    cd final-project

3.  Install the dependencies:

    Make sure you have `[Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/)` and npm installed on your system. Then, install the project's dependencies by running:

    npm install

4.  Run the application:

    To start the application in development mode, use:

    npm start

    This will launch the application in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  Build the application for production (optional):

    If you want to create an optimized build for production, run:

    npm run build

    This will generate a `build` directory with production-ready files.
